"Three-layer-Network-Ansible-managing" is a repository showcasing the automation of VLAN segmentation and routing in a three-layer network architecture using Ansible. This project is particularly designed for implementation in an EVE-NG environment using Cisco Virtual IOS (vIOS) for routers and switches.

Features
VLAN Segmentation and Routing: Automates the creation and routing of VLANs.
Structured for Three-Layer Architecture: Core, distribution, and access layers.
Real-World Network Simulation: Uses EVE-NG with Cisco vIOS.
Organized Configuration Files: Routers and switches configurations are divided into three distinct files named "core," "distributed," and "access" for clarity and ease of management.
Comprehensive Documentation: Detailed instructions for setup and deployment.
Prerequisites
Ansible installed on the control machine.
EVE-NG environment with Cisco vIOS for routers and switches.
Understanding of VLANs, routing, and network architectures.
SSH access to virtual devices in EVE-NG.
Installation & Configuration


This project offers a practical approach to learning and implementing network automation in a structured three-layer network. Customize the playbooks and configurations for your specific network scenario.
